scikit-posthocs
===============

**scikit-posthocs** is a Python package that provides post hoc tests for
pairwise multiple comparisons that are usually performed in statistical
data analysis to assess the differences between group levels if a
statistically significant result of ANOVA test has been obtained.

**scikit-posthocs** is tightly integrated with Pandas DataFrames and NumPy
arrays to ensure fast computations and convenient data import and storage.

This package will be useful for statisticians, data analysts, and researchers
who use Python in their work.


Background
----------

Python statistical ecosystem comprises multiple packages. However, it still has
numerous gaps and is surpassed by R packages and capabilities.

`SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ (version 1.2.0) offers *Student*, *Wilcoxon*,
and *Mann-Whitney* tests that are not adapted to multiple pairwise comparisons.
`Statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`_ (version 0.9.0) features
*TukeyHSD* test that needs some extra actions to be fluently integrated into
a data analysis pipeline. `Statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`_
also has good helper methods: ``allpairtest`` (adapts an external function such
as ``scipy.stats.ttest_ind`` to multiple pairwise comparisons) and
``multipletests`` (adjusts *p* values to minimize type I and II errors).
`PMCMRplus <https://rdrr.io/cran/PMCMRplus/>`_ is a very good R package that
has no rivals in Python as it offers more than 40 various tests (including post
hoc tests) for factorial and block design data. PMCMRplus was an inspiration
and a reference for *scikit-posthocs*.

*scikit-posthocs* attempts to improve Python statistical capabilities by
offering a lot of parametric and nonparametric post hoc tests along with
outliers detection and basic plotting methods.


Features
--------

- *Parametric* pairwise multiple comparisons tests:

  - Scheffe test.
  - Student T test.
  - Tamhane T2 test.
  - TukeyHSD test.

- *Non-parametric* tests for factorial design:

  - Conover test.
  - Dunn test.
  - Dwass, Steel, Critchlow, and Fligner test.
  - Mann-Whitney test.
  - Nashimoto and Wright (NPM) test.
  - Nemenyi test.
  - van Waerden test.
  - Wilcoxon test.

- *Non-parametric* tests for block design:

  - Conover test.
  - Durbin and Conover test.
  - Miller test.
  - Nemenyi test.
  - Quade test.
  - Siegel test.

- Other tests:

  - Anderson-Darling test.
  - Mack-Wolfe test.
  - Hayter (OSRT) test.

- Outliers detection tests:

  - Simple test based on interquartile range (IQR).
  - Grubbs test.
  - Tietjen-Moore test.
  - Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate test (ESD test).

- Plotting functionality (e.g. significance plots).

All post hoc tests are capable of p adjustments for multiple pairwise
comparisons.
